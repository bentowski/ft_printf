This is a 42 school project. In reality you can find in this repo, two of 42 school projects, because i reused the libft for realize ft_printf.
So you can find the ft_printf subjects in the root of the repo, and you can find the libft subjects in the libft folder.

`make` > Just make the project

`make clean` > Clean all objects files

`make fclean` > make clean and clean the executable
